# CCG - Citizen's Conversion Guide
CCG is a 100% client-side, React-based tool used to find the most efficient upgrade paths for Star Citizen ships.

## About CCG
Given your current ship, CCG discovers which ships are available via cross- and intra-chassis upgrade chains. It then computes the cheapest path from your current ship to your final upgrade, getting you the best deal possible.

In some cases, the cheapest paths include converting to ships that aren't currently on sale. These paths are filtered out by default, but can be shown using the checkbox at the top of the result list.

This site was built for use by the [Star Citizen](http://robertsspaceindustries.com/) community. The data it utilizes was based on a [chart](http://i.imgur.com/JzlD7Nd.png) created by [/u/NimmoG on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/2zwtw7/star_citizen_upgrade_paths_flowchart_now_with_rec/). This data is available in JSON format on Github:
